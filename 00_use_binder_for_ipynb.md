# binder

Check https://book.the-turing-way.org/communication/binder/zero-to-binder.html .

1. Note the versions of pytorch shall align with pip install if we use binder.
We can check the binder build log for that.
For e.g., we can use

```
torch==1.13.0
torchvision==0.14.0
torchaudio==0.13.0
```

according to https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/ .

If above, the building may take minutes to finish. Check the log.

2. On Ipad, we can play with Juno.
